# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Set up GitHub to track progress, reviewed how to use GitHub. Begin first project, FCC: Build Tribute Page.

**Thoughts:** I have spent a lot of time in 2016, books and video learning coding, other than exercises I have not built anything.
Today begins the process of creating a portfolio so I can find a job in my new career.
