# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Set up GitHub to track progress, reviewed how to use GitHub. Begin first project, FCC: Build Tribute Page.

**Thoughts:** I have spent a lot of time in 2016, books and video learning coding, other than exercises I have not built anything.
Today begins the process of creating a portfolio so I can find a job in my new career.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**:              Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**:               I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
